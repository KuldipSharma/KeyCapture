This is a keylogger basically for windows only.
To run this program you needs Python 3.1+ to be installed in machine
and some modules name- Pynput, pyWin32, smtplib and base64.

link of Pynput- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynput
or simpy type "pip install pynput" in terminal

or simpy type "pip install smtplib" in terminal
