HELLO THERE I AM NEW TO PROGRAMMING AND I STARTED IT WITH PYTHON3

PLEASE LEAVE A STAR TO BUILD MY SOME CONFIDENCE. 

This is a keylogger basically for windows only.
To run this program you needs Python 3.1+ to be installed in machine
and some modules name- Pynput and pyWin32

link of Pynput- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynput
or simpy type pip install pynput in command prompt

link of pyWin32- https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20221/
CHOOSE CORRECT VERSION ACCORDING TO YOUR PYTHON VERSION AND PYTHON ARCHITECTURE
